Telegram bot that takes a link from a YouTube playlists and gives you a link to a random video from that playlist

Search for in Telegram:
@you_tube_random_video_picker_bot

The playlist should not be private. If the bot doesn't return any link, your playlist may be private. You can change it in the settings of the playlist.

Reading the list can take several seconds, please, be patient

PS. I am using rabbitmq for executing a background task, which might be in overkill for a small bot, but I just wanted to play around with rabbitmq
